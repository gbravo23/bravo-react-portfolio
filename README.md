# Bravo React Portfolio

This week's challenge involved building a personal portfolio using React. The portfolio includes projects I have worked on as well as my contact information. My Github, Linkedin and Facebook have been included to make it easy for future job recruiters to find and contact me.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
